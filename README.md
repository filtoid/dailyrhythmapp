# dailyrhythmapp
A TODO list app for repetitive tasks - allowing the tracking and feedback on daily tasks or self-improvement.

## Concept
The purpose of this project is primarily as way for me (@filtoid) to create a well defined and discrete project in React Native, as a way of learning. In addition to this it also serves a second function. I found I had several tasks that I wanted to work on every day but wanted to track them. That is the purpose of this "TODO list" application - to allow tasks to be created and then worked on every day, tracking the amount of time that has been dedicated to each one, as well as a way of dealing with one-off tasks that needed doing at the same time. 

## Usage
You can create new tasks using the button on the front screen and can set a target time (or 0 to ignore that feature). When back on the main screen hit the play button to start tracking time and stop button to stop it again. The timer will reset at midnight and while the values are stored, for now they aren't retrievable but this is planned for future work.

## Development
The project is still under development, if anyone would fancy getting in touch and offering any advice, I would be very grateful, please feel free to offer Pull Requests or functionality requests. 

Please feel free to fork, I intend for this project to be free and open source, forever. And if you do something cool with it I'd love to hear about it. Thanks, Filtoid :)
