# dailyrhythmapp
A TODO list app for repetitive tasks - allowing the tracking and feedback on daily tasks or self-improvement.

## Concept
The purpose of this project is primarily as way for me (@filtoid) to create a well defined and discrete project in React Native, as a way of learning. In addition to this it also serves a second function. I found I had several tasks that I wanted to work on every day but wanted to track them. That is the purpose of this "TODO list" application - to allow tasks to be created and then worked on every day, tracking the amount of time that has been dedicated to each one, as well as a way of dealing with one-off tasks that needed doing at the same time. 

## Development
The project is still under development, if anyone would fancy getting in touch and offering any advice, I would be very grateful, however for now I am not looking for Pull Requests or functionality suggestions, at this time at least. Please feel free to fork, however, as I intend for this project to be free and open source, forever. And if you do something cool with it please let me know. Thanks, Filtoid :)
